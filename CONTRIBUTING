=== Contributing to this project

The preferred way to report bugs about diffoscope, as well as suggest fixes
and requests for improvements, is to submit reports to the Debian bug
tracker for the 'src:diffoscope' package.  You can do this over e-mail;
link:https://www.debian.org/Bugs/Reporting[the bug tracker has instructions
for sending in your report.]  If you're on a Debian-based system, you can
install and use the 'reportbug' package to help walk you through the
process.

You can submit patches to the Debian bug tracker too.  Start by cloning the
link:https://anonscm.debian.org/git/reproducible/diffoscope.git/tree/[diffoscope
Git repository].  Make your changes and commit them as you normally would.
Then you can use Git's 'format-patch' command to save your changes as a
series of patches that can be attached to the report you submit.

One possible workflow:
----
  git clone git://anonscm.debian.org/reproducible/diffoscope.git
  cd diffoscope
  git checkout origin/master -b <topicname>
  # <edits>
  git commit -a
  git format-patch -M origin/master
----

The 'format-patch' command will make a series of '.patch' files in your
checkout.  Attach these files to your submission in your e-mail client or
reportbug.

=== Uploading the package

When uploading diffoscope to the Debian archive, please take extra care to
make sure the uploaded source package is correct, that is it includes the
files tests/data/test(1|2).(a|o) which in some cases are removed by dpkg-dev
when building the package. See https://bugs.debian.org/834315 for an example
ftbfs bug caused by this and see https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=735377#44
and followups to learn how this happened and how to prevent it.

After uploading, please also update the version on PyPI using::

   $ python3 setup.py sdist upload --sign
